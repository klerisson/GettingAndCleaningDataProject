# Code Book for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This code book describes the steps performed to clean up the data:
* 0: Download the data if it does not already exists in the working directory.
* 1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* 2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* 3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
* 4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
* 5: Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
